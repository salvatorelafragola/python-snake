# Snake Game
This is a Python project that implements the classic game of Snake. The game features two difficulty levels: Easy and Normal. In the Easy level, the objective is to simply eat the apples to score points. However, in the Normal difficulty, players must be careful of poisoned apples, which will decrease their score. If the score goes below zero, the game is lost.

This project is my first Python project, and I have customized it by adding some additional features, such as the introduction of poisoned apples in the Normal difficulty level.

# Installation
To play the Snake game, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Run the game by executing the command python main.py.
# How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement.
In the Easy level, eat as many apples as possible to score points.
In the Normal level, avoid the poisoned apples and try to maintain a positive score.
If the snake collides with the walls or with its own body, the game ends.
Enjoy playing the Snake game and have fun!
